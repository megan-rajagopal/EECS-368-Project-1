		<h1>Connect Four</h1>
		<p> The objective of the game is to get four of your color circles in a uninterrupted line. The line can be straight or diagnol <br>
			This game is a player vs player game. So, you and your opponent choose who will start first. <br>
			To start the game press the color that will start the game or press random to have a random player start. <br>
			To place your token/piece in the board, simply press the drop button above the desired column. Once the button is pressed, it will automatically drop the token at the lowest spot <br>
			After the game ends, press the color that you want to start the next game or press random to have a random player start. <br>
			If you wish to reset the board in the middle of a game, refresh the browser.
